Description: Storing huge data in RData format causes problems because of the nessesity to load the whole file to the memory in order to access and manipulate objects inside such file; rtape is a simple solution to this problem. The package contains serveral wrappers of R built-in serialize/unserialize mechanism allowing user to quickly append objects to a tape-like file and later iterate over them requiring only one copy of each stored object to reside in memory a time.

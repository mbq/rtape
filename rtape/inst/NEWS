    - HEAD argument in rtapeLapply and rtapeAsList.

Changes in 2.2:
    - Fixed typos in docs and description files.
    - Fixed read problems due to localised error messages.

Changes in 2.1:
    - Fixed bug that was making rtape prematurely stop reading when
    encountering an object of a "try-error" class.

Changes in 2.0:
    - Changed the argument order for rtapeRerecord and rtapeFilter
    to be easier to use. Code using 1.x version of those is most likely
    broken.
    - When rerecording a tape onto itself, the temporary file is now
    created in the same dir as a target tape instead in tempdir().
    It solves a problem of renaming when tmp is on the other partition.

Changes in 1.2:
    - "Safe mode" for thread-safe writes to the tape.

Changes in 1.0:
    - First public release.
